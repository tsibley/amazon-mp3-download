Download multiple songs from Amazon's cloud player with a single click
instead of tediously selecting and downloading each song one by one.

## How?

First save
<a href="javascript:%28function%28s%29%7Bs.type%3D%22application%2Fjavascript%22%3Bs.src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ftsibley%2Famazon-mp3-download%2Fmaster%2Famazon-mp3-download.js%22%3Bdocument.head.appendChild%28s%29%3B%7D%29%28document.createElement%28%22script%22%29%29">this link</a>
as a bookmark.

Then navigate to any Amazon cloud player page with the songs you want to
download displayed in the track list.  An album page works well.  Click
on the bookmarklet you saved, and watch the downloads kick off in your
browser!

## Why?

I wrote this because Amazon no longer offers downloading of multiple
songs with a single click on Linux.  While they still allow simultaneous
downloads of songs, they require you to click at least three times for
each download (uncheck previous song, check next song, click download).
